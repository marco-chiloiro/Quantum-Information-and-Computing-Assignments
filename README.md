# Quantum Information and Computing Assignments
This repository compiles all completed assignments from the Quantum Information and Computing course. Each assignment folder contains a report (or slides for the first two assignments), providing a concise theoretical explanation of the work, implementation details, and results. The corresponding source code is also included in each folder.
## Table of contents
  - **Assignment 1**: Setup, number precision, testing performance of matrix-matrix multiplication using FORTRAN. 
  - **Assignment 2**: Checkpoint function, documentation, derived types (module) in FORTRAN.
  - **Assignment 3**: Subroutines implementation from FORTRAN to Python (f2py3), eigenproblem, random matrix theory.
  - **Assignment 4**: One-dimension, time-independent quantum harmonic oscillator.
  - **Assignment 5**: Time evolution of one-dimension, time-dependent quantum harmonic oscillator.
  - **Assignment 6**: N-body system state represantation, density matrix, reduced density matrix.
  - **Assignment 7**: Transverse-field Ising model.
